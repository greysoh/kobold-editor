Welcome to Kobold! This is a simple text editor I wrote to be hackable, but also (somewhat) easily usable.
Admittedly, I can't take a lot of credit for this project:
  - WebContainers: Web-based containers API I'm using
  - Ace Editor: Embedded text editor
  - Xterm.JS: Web-based terminal emulator

However, everything else is mine (you can probably tell based on the quality, lol)
This is designed to be a simple editor for use with WebContainers that isn't as heavy as something like the
amazing VSCode port (way more practical to use that, imo)

Currently, this project is around 400-500 lines of code that I have written(!)
This project (should be by the time you see this) is open source on https://github.com/greysoh/kobold-editor

-- Safety
This is entirely safe as it doesn't run any actual code on your computer, and instead is a playground of sorts.

-- Halp!!!
If you see this and you're stuck, you probably accidentally closed out of the project selection prompt. If you have
any other issues, feel free to report them at https://github.com/greysoh/kobold-editor/issues (you'll need a Git account)
